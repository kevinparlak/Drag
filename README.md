AERSP 402 - Aircraft Design project

This project was developed in AERSP 402 - Aircraft Design at Penn State University.  This code was first developed by Dr. Jack Langelaan.  This code was further edited by Kevin Parlak.  Members of the design team involved in contributions to this code were: Kevin Parlak, Kirsten Muirhead, Jack Wathen, Joe Phifer, Max Denbin, Jake Popowycz, and Luke Georges.

The intent of this project was to design an aircraft in whole.  This code helps to determine drag buildup based on various parameters and output from open-source programs such as XFOIL and AVL.  The drag code for this project was written using Matlab and stitches outputs from XFOIL and AVL to give a drag buildup for the certain aircraft under design considerations.
