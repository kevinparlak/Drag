# drag

AERSP 402 - Aircraft Design project

The intent of this project was to design an aircraft in whole.  This code helps to determine drag buildup based on various parameters and output from open-source programs such as XFOIL and AVL.  The drag code for this project was written using Matlab and stitches outputs from XFOIL and AVL to give a drag buildup for the certain aircraft under design.
